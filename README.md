# Self_Driving_Car

## Installing requirements
## Requires models directory, and data directory (if you plan to train any models)

## To run the most basic demo:
# 1. Move both .pt files in the outermost directory into the /models directory.
# 2. Enter the /GTA directory 'cd /path/to/Self_Driving_Car/GTA'
# 3. Ensure the 'DRIVE' flag on line 8 of drive.py is set to False.
# 4. Play media in the top left of your screen (a youtube video, for instance) at 800 x 600 pixels. 
When the script starts, it will open a window that plays back what the segmentation model is seeing. This can be used to adjust the video into place. Terminal output represents the predicted control.
